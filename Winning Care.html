<p><b>Top Turnout</b> is </b>most efficient.</b> Sound daily routines are easiest and most successful: </p>

<p>•	A good BRIDLE CLEANING is quick, if you are consistent. Tips for easy care and tack that will last a lifetime: http://www.luckybraids.com/edu/TackTrack.pdf 
</p><p>•	Footing shouldn't glob onto HOOVES. Apply a thin veneer of dressing with a folded paper towel. Let dry. Gently brush hooves ringside. 
</p><p>•	SCRIMS are valued mostly for shielding from the sun & keep backs from drafts. <a href="http://www.luckybraids.com/edu/ClothingForWork.pdf">Here are details</a> to dressing horses for work. 
</p><p>•	POLISHED on an overcast day at Devon, Amanda Steege's: gloves are shiny, hat is brushed and coat is very well fitted. 
</p><p>•	The horse's eye is so soft! Totally RELAXED, Balou was not rushed to the ring. Good time management promotes quiet confidence for BIG HEARTS to WIN. I have known Amanda since she was a junior and never saw her harried. Have a plan so you can be all set to show your best. Doing so is a way of Being.
</p><p>•	Bridle FITTING: a good fist full of slack is between the throatlatch & windpipe; the cavesson sits ~2 fingers below the point of the cheek; and the bit shows 2 wrinkles. 
</p><p>•	Earplugs match skin, instead of distracting your eye from the pretty picture.

</p><p>PROPER DAILY CARE saves time + $$. So, aim high. Keep to the good stuff. The little things add up. Manage time well. Be steady and ready. 

</p><p>Good job, Amanda!</p>
