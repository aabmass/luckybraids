<p>Don't cut the mane. If there was a slip of the clippers, hang on. The wispies in this pic could have twisted up or would have the next week.</p>

<p>Always braid the mane when wet, top and bottom. Use the back of your comb as a sweat scraper, so drops of water are not distracting to your horse. Wet hair stretches and folds in better. To grab those short pieces, give a twist to the sections as you grab them at the top. That will tuck the short hair under the rest.</p>
