<p>EXFOLIATING and increasing CIRCULATION promotes well-being on many levels. Since it promotes soundness and the horse's natural defenses, I like to bathe with a rubber mitt. Great groom Noe prefers a brush.</p>

<p>Skin on heels is very vulnerable to scratches, so a sponge is best there.</p>


<p>Always DRY LEGS thoroughly before putting them in or out. This is your <b>very best defense against scratches.</b> Lucky Braids Shampoo will gently kill crud while leaving hair glistening and skin more resilient to fungus.</p>
