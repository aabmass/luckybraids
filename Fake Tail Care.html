<p>A braider is always happy to see a tail bandage left out, but it is a shame that this tail is not bright white. It happens all the time. People want tails really clean, so they use harsh detergents, then detangler/shine sprays. This dull brittle wig that tangles easily is the result. </p>

<p>Is this the goal? Fake tails are expensive. So are those ribbons! Strut your stuff. Show the judge you know what you are doing by sporting TOP TURNOUT. It is actually MUCH easier to do things more effectively. </p>

<p>To WASH the tail without it tangling, I would let the tail hang. Wet it with a hose. Put the #shampoo on straight or having been diluted in a bucket. With the later, squeeze a sponge over the tail to let the soap run over the tail. Then, with the tail between your hands, rub hair together, down the length. That will get the soap into the tail and cause some friction, without making a mess of it. Then, organize the hair <a href="http://www.shinyhappyhorses.com/pages/tail-tips">this way.</a></p>

<p>IF you use Lucky Braids All-In-One Shampoo and comb the tail wet AS DIRECTED, you won’t need any conditioner nor detangler. The hair will stay separated and super easy to maintain. The first time you comb it may take a bit more time. Go easy. Once you get into the program, it will be a breeze. </p>

<p>If the tail gets dirty and you don’t want to wash it, just spray on the Whitener/Dry Wash and simply wipe off dirt with a towel. Comb wet.</p>

<p>This is a good way to leave tails out for the braider, but I would have the BANDAGE stay up around the top, so hair lower stays fuller/fluffier.

<p>Tail bandages- I like the Deluxe (extra long) cotton blend ones made by Hartmann Conco. Nylon slips too much, which can break hair and compromise the braid. Plus, you need the length so it can be comfortable and secure. Don’t put these tail bandages in the dryer, or the elastic will go like on the one you see here. If you do choose to dry them, don’t overdo it. You can order them by calling Equine Tack & Nutritionals: (800) 833-8225, (954) 725-4774 or equinetack1@gmail.com. They do not look like this, but<a href="http://www.shop.equinetan.com/product.sc?productId=247&categoryId=-1"> this is the link to order them.</a></p>
