<p><strong>Horses get CHOKED.</strong></p>

<p>They can't throw up. So, ingesting the wrong thing is a big problem, which can be lethal. Braiders should be like elves, who leave treasures without any other trace of their visit. Be careful. Keep organized and really clean. No yarn should be left on the aisle. Don't leave or sweep waste in a stall without being absolutely sure your horse's health will not be compromised.</p>
