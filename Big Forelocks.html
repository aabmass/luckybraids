<p><strong>BIG FORELOCKS</strong>

<p>If you pull or cut a forelock, it looks like a bush, never sitting right. A better solution is to cut the bridlepath a bit forward. That is, take some bulk from the backside of the poll. Don't cut to the top of the poll. Because, it will grow in looking like a spike off the top of his head. Instead, just trim up the backside a bit. That takes enough bulk off big forelocks.</p>

<p><strong>FUZZ</strong></p>
<p>I never cut the forelock, but trimming the peach fuzz is okay. The idea is to let the sides of the braid be clean straight lines.</p>
