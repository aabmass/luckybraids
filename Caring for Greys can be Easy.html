<p>Do your greys to glisten? Do your horse's socks appear iridescent?</p>

<p>“Horse Journal” did a non-partisan test of whitening products, awarding <b>TOP PICK for WHITES & GREYS</b> to Lucky Braids Shampoo and Spray. If you don't love, LOVE the All-In-One Shampoo, we'll refund you. The Whitener/Dry Wash Spray will gently dissolve the very toughest and oldest stains. Guaranteed. Great stuff. DIFFERENT LEAGUE.</p>

<p>As a result of the healthier coat, horses even stays cleaner longer. Skin is more resilient to disease and bugs tend to stay away. So, <a href="http://www.shinyhappyhorses.com/collections/all">give them a try.</a></p>
