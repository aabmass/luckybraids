    <p>Well I am impressed Thank you soo much Ruthann for helping to get that wonderful All In One Shampoo to me in Australia Tested it out on one mare today (though only did her tail and 1 hind leg as it was way too cold for any more than that) She hadn’t been washed for close to 10 months (were just coming out of winter now). Her tail scrubbed up beautifully and was so soft and had a lovely shine to it. Her leg was the WOW factor, I didn’t have a brush so just used my fingertips to scrub it in and boy didn’t it shine. Can’t wait to see her once the weather warms up and a whole body wash can be done. My other will get their treatment this weekend.</p>
