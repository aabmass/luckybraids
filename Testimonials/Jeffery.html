        <p class="ellipsis">We use Lucky Braids products. Our horse's full tails are gorgeous. White and sensitive legs get sprayed before they go out to help repel dirt. Initially we used the Salve on scratches and they were better in a day. We also find it effective for treating tail rubbing and scrapes to heal skin and grow hair back quickly.</p>
