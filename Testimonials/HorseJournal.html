        <p class="ellipsis">We found that Lucky Braids by Ruth­ann Shampoo actually improves the texture of the mane and tail for braiding by adding conditioning agents that help to repair dam­age and detangle the hair. Aloe vera adds natural texture and grip to the mane, so it can be braided directly after washing. It also reduces drying and discomfort in the hair—a com­mon side effect of a dirty mane—that can encourage the horse to rub.”</p>
