    <p>Before using Lucky Braids my grey horses' coats were not bright. Now, all of our horses at Millar Brooke Farm gleam. The grey horses are dazzling and easy to keep clean - dirt doesn't stick. All of our tails are full, shiny and easy to keep knot-free. Lucky Braids is a must have product for any horse owner.</p>
