        <p class="ellipsis">This is less than 24 hours later, after my irish got attacked by nike the gelding. this was taken with my cell phone, and not a really good quality. but i have never seen my horse with her legs so shinny before! hallelujah, i know this is the real deal! if my horse hated baths before, she loves them now, with this product! she nearly fell asleep, even when i walked away, she was very content. my horse has been known to pull when getting a bath, but this time... she just fell asleep, as i walked away. some times you dont always know what horses are trying to tell you, but i figured it out this time! this is a very very happy shiny horse, right here! so very proud of her legs!</p>
