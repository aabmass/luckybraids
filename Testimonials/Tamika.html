        <p>The first shot is the color of my horses tail when I got her. The second shot after 3 months of working on it with three highly recommended whiteners. The third shot is after ONE WASH with Lucky Braids Shampoo....didn't even let it sit in or anything! Ruthann, you have a new client in me!</p>
