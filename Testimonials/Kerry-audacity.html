    <p>Absolutely love your shampoo. The practice here is to clip out their white socks, which I don't do on Audacity as he tends to get sunburned and then develop mud fever. Your shampoo brings up the socks in a lustrous sheen and his coat and mane is SO soft afterwards it's like satin to the touch. 
While his coat is always quite shiny we've had problems with the above mentioned mud fever/photosensitivity so I have had issues with shampoos stripping the oils. Not so with the Lucky Braids shampoo and I've every confidence in using it on his white legs.
This photo was taken yesterday at his first ever show. Thanks, Ruthann your assistance and product has been greatly appreciated.</p>
