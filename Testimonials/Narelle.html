        <p class="ellipsis">I have a bay/brown mare &amp; people always comment on how clean she is. I recently washed a 32 year old grey that has been retired in the paddock for a decade with Lucky Braids for Top Turnout shampoo, OMG! The horse glowed white, the results were amazing! Cannot recommend your product enough, especially impressed on results for greys &amp; pallys. Thanks.</p>
