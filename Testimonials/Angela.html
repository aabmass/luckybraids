    <p>Ruthann, just wanted to share this photo of my horse last night. I have been using the Lucky Braids shampoo for a year, and absolutely love it. This is my 25 year old TB gelding last night before grooming. He has always had a great coat, but your shampoo takes it to the next level!</p>

    <p>For anyone who is hesitant to make the investment in Lucky Braids shampoo.... DO IT! This stuff is amazing! Gentle enough to use regularly, it really does leave your horse looking fabulous! I use it a few times a week to help cleanse away any sweat or fly spray residue, and it is also great for preventing skin issues. I think that the tea tree oil also helps to deter ticks, because my horse is the only one that they won't touch. Worth every penny!</p>
