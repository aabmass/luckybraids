        <p class="ellipsis">I LOVE LOVE LOVE your shampoo!! I've always had to keep my boys mane braided because as soon as he would shake his head, his entire mane would be in one giant knot. I started using your shampoo and for the first time in 6 years, I was able to keep his mane down. This was taken on Thursday, his mane hadn't been braided in a week and I didn't brush it. This was after he played and rolled in the arena as well.</p>
