        <p class="ellipsis">I thought I would update you to let you know how my horse's scrape is doing. I started putting the Handy Salve on the area a week ago (when it arrived in the mail) and it had no hair at all, and was red and sore from sunburn. Within two days, the scrape had hair growing sparsely, and it is now totally covered by growing hairs! It is also not red anymore. I am so impressed, and have been applying the Salve to other nicks on my horse, as well as to his tailbone to prevent him rubbing which he tends to do when the flies come out this time of year. Thank you for the awesome products!</p>
