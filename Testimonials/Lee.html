        <p class="ellipsis">Yesterday the dog was sick - I mean colossally sick - all over a lovely old cowhide that graces our dining room floor. What to do? It was time for the big guns! I dragged it outside by two fingers, along with the Lucky Braids Shampoo! Figured if it was good enough for show horses, it would work on the remains of a cow. It did; dried lustrous, soft and shiny. The rug is back in situ and even the dog is feeling better now. Thanks for a great product!</p>
