    <p>Just want to share... this is my second braid job since I got your DVD. I hadn't braided in over ten years, and I used to do rubber bands, so I've got a lot to assimilate. Planning to watch the DVD again and try another one next week. I'd like to earn some extra money braiding this year, so I'm practicing regularly. My fuzzball horse makes it a bit tough - I keep braiding his coat into the base of the braid! Thanks for the great DVD! And I love your yarn, too - although I wish my boyfriend had thought to order black, lol. (It was a Christmas present.)</p>
