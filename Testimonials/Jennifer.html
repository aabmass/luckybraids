        <p class="ellipsis">I just received my shampoo and have to comment. I've tried it on 3 horses, and I'm impressed. I love the clean rinse out. At first, I didn't think the hair felt "conditioned", but once the horses were dry, hair was clean, soft and full. I'm an advocate of good nutrition, good grooming and no products. My horses are super shiny, the All in One shampoo just adds to that. Thanks, Ruthann. Great product!</p>
