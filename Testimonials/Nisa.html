        <p class="ellipsis">One of my horses had a terrible problem with rubbing her mane and tail for years (especially in the summer), and up until I purchased this product, I couldn't find a solution. And believe me, I tried EVERYTHING. I was honestly a little skeptical, but after the first use, the rubbing stopped immediately, and I didn't notice any signs of further irritation for at least a month. Then, I applied it again and the rubbing stopped for good. This stuff is worth every penny, and a little goes a long way, so it really is cost effective. Try it, you won't be disappointed!</p>
