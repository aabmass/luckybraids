        <p class="ellipsis">I enjoyed the clinic very much. It's taken the mystery out of how to get perfect braids. My daughter had the last day of her jumper clinic on Sunday, so I practiced on her pony. Only 3 mane braids, the forelock and the tail with the pinwheel. He looked great. Thanks again for coming such a long way!</p>
