        <p class="ellipsis">Horse Shampoo....I did a test yesterday between the 2 most suggested shampoos and I was totally disappointed with one of them. Lucky Braids for Top Turnout is far superior than the other one tested. I wish I hadn't spent the money to try it out. I had to scrub three times as much and it still did not get the pony near as clean as Lucky Braids. I won't be branching out again!</p>
