        <p class="ellipsis">Just wanted to post that I have a VERY sensitive OTTB that is really thin skinned. He's always been good about grooming but prefers soft rubber curries and brushes ... nothing hard or stiff. BUT his favorite part of grooming BY FAR is when I walk around him dabbing the Lucky Braids Handy Salve on any scrapes, scruff, or on his belly center line. He literally drops his head and almost goes to sleep. I can only assume it feels great!</p>
