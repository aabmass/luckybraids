<p><strong>        ALL-IN-ONE SHAMPOO </strong>is all you’ll need. It does the work of daily, anti-fungal, anti-itch, whitening and color shampoos, shine agents, conditioners, detanglers and scratches medication with superior results. Most shampoos use salt (sodium chloride) to make the lather. They parch skin strip natural oils and leaving coats susceptible to skin disease. Plus, the dry porous hair is thirsty- grabbing onto everything. Lucky Braids Shampoo is SATURATED with ALOE VERA, leaving coats nourished moisturized, so they stay cleaner longer.</p>
<p>        Since we use only the finest, PHARMACEUTICAL-GRADE of nature’s best antiseptic anti-fungal TEA TREE OIL, horses bathed with Lucky Braids have no scurf, crud, dander, rainrot, itching or scratches (as long as you dry legs before putting them in a stall, of course). It also makes braiding clean manes and clipping easier.</p>
<p>        Economical concentrate rinses clean and fast. Plus, you won’t need to buy, manage or ship so many products. This shampoo is the most effective, easy to use and cost-effective.</p>

<p><strong>       TAIL TIP: </strong>Comb clean tails while wet. To protect the roots, twist the length and hold the bottom. Using a fat comb, always start from the bottom as you work your way up the wet tail. Organize hair to roots. Tails dry full and fluffy while resisting tangles. No expensive detanglers or conditioners are needed.</p>
