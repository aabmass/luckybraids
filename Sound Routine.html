<p><strong>KEEP 'EM DRINKING!</strong></p>

<p>Horses need to be well hydrated to avert illness.</p>

<p><strong>KEEP IT FRESH AND EASY.</strong></p>

<p>When it's hot, change water twice a day so it stays yummy. Let them drink before bathing and/or grooming. When traveling, offer them water with apple juice or Denji in it. They'll happily slurp it up. Then, toss the remaining water and rinse bucket as it would ferment.</p>
