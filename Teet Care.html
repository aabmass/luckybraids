<p>Some mares need their teats wiped *every* day. They get crusty. You can see all the areas that could hold it. Crusty is not comfortable and can inspire tail rubbing.</p>

<p>I would not use handy wipes. Many have drying ingredients. A clean damp cloth or paper towel will do. In my experience, keeping it simple is best. Just water. No guck. Once clean, you can use a soft brush or towel to keep skin healthy.</p>

<p>If you have not been keeping up on your mare's teats, she may be defensive. The flank is a vulnerable area. Dirty teats can be sore. So, go easy. Maybe start with shampoo and a sponge. Then keep up on them.</p>
