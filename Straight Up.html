<p>What else lets you be with horses and make good money with little overhead?? Braiding well offers tremendous FREEDOMS. Regardless of your riding discipline, consider this… I have never needed to work for anyone. I did, when I wanted to learn. HOWEVER, I could always braid. I've been pro since the age of 9.</p>

<p>RULES for Going Pro:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Get GREAT. Your reputation starts out of the gate. You need rhythm and technique to consistently lay down a perfect bottomline. Do your groundwork. 

</li><li>Say NO. If you are good, people will beg you to braid. But, things happen. Plan on glitches. When you don’t have enough time, things cycle negative and long into the future. The ingate goes not wait. Only you will be to blame. Don’t blow it. Just say no. 

</li><li>Be a HORSEMAN, always tuned in and able to read horses to STAY SAFE. Don’t get ahead of yourself on this front. The goal is to send horses to the ring sound and level-headed. Relaxed, they can focus to be successful. When twisting leaves the horse centered and confident, those are #LuckyBraids. 
</li>
</ol>

<p>I realize a lot of people try to learn from online videos. HOWEVER, the proof is in the pudding. There is braiding and there is BRAIDING. We are NOT seeing many good braiders. Most braid jobs were NOT up to par. Braiding with all your heart does not do it. You need to know those little push and pulls that make all the difference. GOAL: Maintain that perfect bottomline all day. Make braids sing competence. </p>

<p>Note: it is *easier* to be great. The work is more enjoyable and lucrative. However, you <b>MUST</b> MASTER a proven formula for laying down gorgeous braid jobs quickly, with no cramped hands. </p>

<p>Before making the Lucky Braids how-to braid DVD/Tool, I had been teaching the craft for 15 years. Having determined inclinations, I had figured out how to optimize your learning curve. My system is much like equitation. It is a very specific finger form. Once you have that down, you can successfully tie up any way you want: buttons, rosettes, French, hunter braids, etc. The key is to have accurate finger form for braids that are sturdy and even. Then, that absolutely perfect bottomline can last throughout the day’s activities. <a href="http://www.shinyhappyhorses.com/pages/video-preview">Here’s a preview</a> of the level of detail outlined and versatility of what is taught in the DVD/Tool. I’d wager, seasoned or beginner, you’ll learn more than anticipated.
