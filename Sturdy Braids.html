<p>Here are super sturdy braids with perfect visual rhythm and a clean bottomline. These are sure to endure the day's activities. They are rock solid and comfy.</p>

<p>On greys, bright white yarn distracts the eye from the bottomline, which is the most important element of braiding manes. You want yarn that is a bit off white. It should also be really strong so you can crank on the braids. Yarn that stretches allows for better finessing of the bottomline. The stretch is also pivotal to braids that sit taut to the neck. Giggling and twisting braids are unnecessary faux pas.</p>

<p>The visual rhythm of the uniformity comes from a physical rhythm. It is like equitation. When your body is in the proper position, it's easy to balance to the next movement. That is how we can braid quickly, with no cramped hands. Averaging ~35 minutes, on weekends we normally do 12-17 horses a night.</p>

<p>This Top Turnout Salute goes to braider Michelle Price Williams. All her manes look like this.</p>
