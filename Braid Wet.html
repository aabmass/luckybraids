<p>We wet manes and tails to braid them. Damp hair stretches, so braids dry tighter and wispies are minimized. Plus, the moisture helps us work the hair. </p>

<p>Normally we use a dandy brush or sponge to wet over the top and bottom of the crest. Some use a clip to hold unbraided hair to the side, though I use my braiding comb. When we need to re-wet hair, we break our rhythm. That takes time and can compromise our feel for the sizing. SO, a mechanism for keeping manes from drying would be a great thing! </p>

<p>Here’s the TIP:</p>

<p>Wet the mane well, comb the moisture through and then place a damp towel over it. The towel keeps the mane from drying and can hold hair out of the way as well. BRILLIANT! </p>

<p>All the credit for this one goes to Leslie that takes care of the famed <a href="https://www.facebook.com/nickskelton">Nick Skelton's</a> horses.</P.

<p>NOTE: I wet manes with only water. The spray on braiding product makes hair too slippery, then in short time too sticky. It is expensive, strains my hands, then slows me down. Rhythm is key to getting braids uniform. <b>The visual rhythm comes from a physical rhythm.</b></p>
