<p>Here is some *evolution of braiding.* The style had moved from the rosettes/buttons toward today’s hunter braids. </p>

<p>They shifted numbers from identifying gender to elongating the neck.</p>

<p>The perfectly straight #bottomline to the braids and the visual rhythm of them makes the neck look longer.</p>

<p>When the straight line is pitched so braids are longer toward the poll, than the crest, the horse looks rounder. It closes off the throat latch, too. 
</p>

<p>The more evolved style of today is optimized. It enhances conformation, making the neck look long and round or flat, whichever you prefer. Braids stay all day, but are redone every day to save the mane and sport top turnout.
</p>

<p>After this most delightful photo of Bill Haggard and Bold Minstrel at Devon, the braiding technique advanced. We now can not only achieve that perfect bottomline. We can lay down braids that maintain it all day. </p>
