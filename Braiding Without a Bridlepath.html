<p>I like a bridlepath to keep hair organized. An inch or so that sits just under the bridle can make things easy and crisp. However, trimmers tend to wander. For braidable disciplines, a long bridlepath interrupts the long line of the neck and means one less braid. Therefore, instead of risking a bridelpath too long, some trainers ban them.</p>

<p>If you braid a horse without a bridlepath, it can look like a mat of wispies. To keep it neat and comfortable, I recommend starting the French forelock under where the bridle sits. Then, reinforce the braid there. Lace it up as you would your shoe. Crisscross the front of the braid with the yarn. Pull it through the back of the braid at each rung to cage/hold in the hair at the top, where it needs it. Use two surgical knots to reinforce/lock in each pass. So, regardless of the style, you can have beautiful, comfortable braids.</p>
