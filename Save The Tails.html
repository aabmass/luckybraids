<p><b>Tails Braided for Show</b></p>

<p>There are some <b>hard & fast rules.</b> Don’t learn the hard way... Tails are very DELICATE and have been known to fall out and off. The whole thing! They can lose the hair <b>and</b> dock.</p>

<p>Braiders Rules:</p>

<ul>

<li>When you braid as seen here, you should **NEVER leave tail braids in*** for a second day. 
</li><li>Even if someone insists on leaving in the mane, tails are REDONE DAILY. Anyone who leaves them in, does not know. No one knowledgeable would do that. Horsemen have tails re-braided every day. Or, they go without. Period. 
</li><li>Tails get braided after midnight. If we start with manes at 9, after midnight we do mane/tails. After 4 am, we run and catch the other early tails. 
</li><li>For one-days, if manes get done at home, tails are best done at the show. You don’t want them sitting on the braid in the trailer. It can destroy the hair, which means no more braiding for the season or longer.
</li><li>Braids should be covered with a bandage whenever not in the ring and be taken out ASAP. 
</li><li>A tight bandage can cut blood supply and kill the tail bone. 
</li><li>I prefer a <a href="http://shop.farmvet.com/Horse/First-aid/Ace-Bandage">extra long cotton ace-type bandage.</a></li>
</ul>
