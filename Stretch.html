<p>Stretching horse’s legs before mounting is routine for good grooms.  It can even improve performance.  If the horse feels good, he not only wants to play.  He can also move freely.  So, please consider stretching legs, but only and always with extreme caution.</p>

<div class="figure"><a href="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0529/1857/files/Stretch_2.jpg?3761"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0529/1857/files/Stretch_2.jpg?3761" alt="Stretching Legs" style="float:right;margin:0 5px 0 0;"/></a><p>Always support the leg as you gently lower it, allowing the horse to balance.   Remember: reins over the neck, use two hands and watch he does not put his foot through anything.</p>
</div>
<p>The idea is to stretch the skin under the girth or cinch so it is not folded and pinching your horse.  In the barn, position the saddle and pull the girth safely snug so the saddle does not slide.  A saddle that slides under the belly can cause an accident.  Right before mounting, pull the girth tighter.  Then, stretch the legs to ensure the horse’s comfort.</p>

<p>You’ll need both hands.  When you lower the leg, you don’t want to drop the reins.  So, fold the reins and hold them between two fingers in one hand.  Support behind the knee with that palm.  The other hand supports the toe.  Using two hands will also help you feel when each leg is extended far enough.</p>

<blockquote>
    <h2><strong>Heads Up:</strong></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Organize your reins carefully.  A foot through them can be catastrophic.</li>
        <li>Allow the horse time to balance before lifting and lowering his legs.</li>
        <li>Gently support the leg as you lift and lower it.</li>
    </ul>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>After your reins are organized, ask the horse to lift one front leg as if you were intending to pick his hoof.  When he lifts the leg, move in front and to the side of the shoulder.  Allow the horse time to redistribute his weight to balance.  Then, gently and slowly support and extend each front leg forward, but not past the point of comfort.  Don’t let the leg drop.  When done properly, horses enjoy this stretch.  If you let their leg slam down or yank too hard, they are not going to appreciate your efforts.  Always support the leg.</p>

<p>Proper turnout requires tack fitting well.  A horse that is dressed appropriately and moves easily can be a willing partner.  Fashion follows function.  So, be sure your horse is comfortable to enjoy his big heart.</p>

<h2><strong>Saddle Comforts</strong></h2>
<ul>
    <li>In the barn, position the saddle well.</li>
    <li>Always pull the saddle pad or blanket up high into the pommel before pulling the girth safely snug.  You want to keep the saddle from sliding while allowing the horse to relax.</li>
    <li>Right before mounting, securely tighten the girth for safe riding.</li>
    <li>After the girth is pulled tight, carefully stretch each front leg forward.</li>
    <li>Later, dismount, run your stirrups up, loosen your noseband and girth so it is comfortable, yet still safely snug for a safe journey back to the barn.</li> 
</ul>
