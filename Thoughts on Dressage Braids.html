<p>I find doorknob braids to be counterproductive.</p>

<p>For the horse to be able to flex well, you can't have a clean topline. To me it looks like drapes. Plus, this horse does not need his neck to look any thicker. I'd be more interested in seeing him carry himself; be light in hand.</p>

<p>At the start of a recent Florida circuit, the trend was 8 braids. HOWEVER, by the end of season, they all had gone back to at least 15, more like 29 braids in dressage manes. I like 35. Mostly, it is about how the braids sit on the neck. Braids should look painted-on. No jiggling,and a perfectly clean bottomline. Add that the horses goes to the ring level-headed, and those are lucky braids.</p>
