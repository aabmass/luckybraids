<p>Recently I mentioned trimming manes to help reduce tangles. Once in a while, we brush upon techniques that are such a given in my world, I don’t realize what you might hear. I apologize for any misunderstanding. Please allow me to clarify.</p>

<p>Just like with people, hair with thin, scraggy ends is prone to tangling. If you just snip thin ends off, they won’t wrap around themselves as readily. If the mane is natural/long, you can trim a little along the swooping line of the mane.</p>

<p>I would never cut a mane straight across. It would fall in clumps, which looks unnatural and amateur. If a mane falls in a clean, blunt-looking line, it is not cut with scissors. Although it looks blunt, its tapered, even if slightly. The easiest way to achieve a clean bottom line to the mane is by teasing and cutting a few strands at time with a body clipper blade, preferably an Oster 84 AU. An old one that needs to be sharpened will work just fine. I apologize for the scan, but <a href="http://www.shinyhappyhorses.com/pages/peaceful-mane-pulling">this article</a> best demonstrates my technique.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.shinyhappyhorses.com/pages/mane-prep">Here</a> are more details to maintaining manes most effectively</p>

<p>I would not cut nor pull a forelock. They don’t sit right if you fuss with them. I chose this image because it is just too cute. The groom was super proud, and with good reason. This Dutch boy cut works, somehow. If you look closely, you can see the ends are reddish. So, the groom only cut the thin ends ever so slightly to create that line. That’s why it is not clumping.</p>

<p>Anyway, I thought we’d give this groom his day. Look at how shiny the nostril is. That’s from toweling LOTS. The horse’s lip tells the story that he is delighted and exited to be going to the ring with his guy. I really got the feeling these two were thick as thieves. I love that!</p>
