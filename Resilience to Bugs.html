<p><strong>BUGS & SKIN</strong></p>

<p> Everyone asks about repellents. Let's think about this… Has this ever happened to you?... After a day in the sun, a mosquito bites your arm. You give it a quick itch.. and then WANT TO RIP YOUR ARM OFF! Dry skin is intolerant. Its natural defense and elasticity has been depleted. However, HEALTHY SKIN IS RESILIENT.</p>

<p>We speak of pests and skin disease. What about helping the skin be more supple and less sensitive? Would you go without moisturizer? I am not saying an enormous horse fly won't hurt. But, bugs tend to like some people more than others. So, if you horse is not the easiest target, if its skin is super healthy… </p>

<p>You do have the option to choose a more empowering strategy. Most shampoos strip the coats. Salt is a standard ingredient. Sprays tend to be oil-based, which attracts the drying sun and dirt. On the other hand, Lucky Braids All-In-One Shampoo actually enhances the oils in the coat. It BOOSTS NATURAL DEFENSES. Fleas have been known to just fall off dogs shampooed with Lucky Braids All-In-One Shampoo. The highly respected elder groom, Billy Dixon, has been known to squeal, “My horse is so shiny… Look! Flies just fall off!”</p> 

<p>I have spent my life as a groom and braider. So, I think differently than chemists with marketing dollars. For me, the horses come first. Always. God knows, braiding 12,000+ horses alone in the dark, I had plenty of time to consider the root of pervasive problems, as well as sound tactics for not only treating, but averting them.</p>

<p>If you do get a bad bite or itching, Lucky Braids Handy Salve will break the itching cycle and help it heal quickly. With superficial wounds, such as bad boot rubs, bites and scrapes, countless people have told me the hair grows back in 3 days. The idea is that the Handy Salve will break the cycle or treat something acute, while All-In-One Shampoo will help keep you out of the loop. I knew a horse that was so itchy he tried to knock you over during grooming. With just one Lucky Braids bath, and he was totally COMFORTABLE IN HIS SKIN.</p>

<p>As far as price, Lucky Braids Shampoo cost less than medicated shampoo and detangler, which you won't even need. It's highly concentrated. Plus, you won't need to treat so many skin issues, nor need so much stuff! You can get rid of the: daily, medicated, and whitening shampoos as well as detangler (comb tails wet), shine agents, scratches medication (only bone dry legs go out or in stalls), conditioner, etc. Lucky Braids Shampoo is truly all-in-one. It's all you'll need. Most importantly, horses will look and feel better.</p>
