<p>CLEAN IS NOT ENOUGH- Antibacterial soaps DO NOT kill fungus. Instead, they PROMOTE SKIN DISEASE by drying out crud, but also stripping natural defenses. Dish soap and medicated shampoos typically ultimately feed the negative cycle of skin disease. 
</p>

<p>To truly treat and prevent crud, two acts are pivotal:</p>
<p>1. Gently eliminate fungus and impurities</p>
<p>2. Enhance natural defenses</p>

<p>Tea tree oil is nature's best anti-fungal AND anti-bacterial. **HOWEVER,** it can be very harsh. Use a dog or horse shampoo that ***specifies*** PHARMACEUTICAL or MEDICAL GRADE. It is a more expensive ingredient. So, if the packaging does not stipulate the grade, you can assume it is not the finest quality.</p>

<p>Help the skin by both protecting and fortifying it. Your best defense is to always towel dry legs. Only BONE DRY legs should go out or in after a bath. Otherwise, damp skin is super susceptible to fungus. Toweling increases circulation and natural protective oils. Vigorous toweling is a good habit. 
</p>

<p>If you want a shampoo that ALSO leaves coats MORE RESILIENT, <a href="http://www.shinyhappyhorses.com/collections/all/products/lucky-braids-shampoo-1-quart">Lucky Braids All-In-One Shampoo</a> is all you need. If you dry legs well, horses should not get scratches. Rain rot goes away. Itching typically ceases. Skin gets supple and heals well. Coats, even greys', glisten. Tails grow great and are volumized (comb wet). It is super concentrated and rinses in a snap. Different game.
