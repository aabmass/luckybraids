<p>Here are Ruthann’s tips to saving time and money while enjoying healthy top turnout™</p>

<br></br>

<h2><strong>Fungus, Crud, Scurf and Scratches</strong></h2>

<p>Lucky Braids Shampoo  prevents and treats most skin issues. Saturated with ALOE VERA and lots of Vitamin E, it <strong>conditions</strong>  and <strong>moisturizes</strong>.  Medical-grade  antiseptic <strong>Tea Tree</strong> oil eliminates irritants <strong>without</strong> stripping natural oils. It soothes and enriches, leaving coats resilient, glistening and easy to keep clean.<p>

<p>Use Lucky Braids Handy Salve to break the cycle if tail rubbing or heel scratches are already sore. It eliminates the irritants as well as reduces swelling while conditioning skin and roots to promote healing and hair re-growth.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Lucky Braids Shampoo is the only one that does not dry out the horses’ coats.
It leaves the horses super-shiny and we have NO skin problems, even in Florida. I love it! The horses love it!”</p><br></br>

<h2><strong>Greys + Tough Stains</strong></h2>

<p>Whiten  and  shine  greys  best  with  Lucky  Braids  Shampoo. No  other  whitening shampoo  is  needed.  This  brightens,  conditions  and  rinses  fast.  Horses  even  stay cleaner longer. Trade stains for big shine instantly with Lucky Braids Whitener/Dry Wash  gentle enzymatic spray. Douse old stains and yellow tails. Let sit wet with this spray to finally dissolve tough stains.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Lucky Braids uses the highest quality ingredients. The Shampoo and Spray system makes the horses easy to clean and even the greys shine. We use it on all our horses. Now, we need far less products and I like that they don’t need to stand under the hose so much. Most importantly, the coats are healthier and more resilient than ever.”</p>
<br></br>

<h2><strong>Tail Breakage</strong></h2>

<p>Reduce tangles and volumize tails while nourishing and moisturizing for stronger hair and healthy growth. No drying detangler needed. After bathing with Lucky Braids Shampoo, gently hold tail to comb. Work your way up while holding the tail to protect the roots. When tail dries, just pick with your fingers to fluff. If the tail is dirty, use the Dry Wash Spray to instantly clean any color tail.</p>

<p>These products solve the toughest cases. Lucky Braids Shampoo helps prevent irritation, soothes, conditions and enriches skin. Lucky Braids Handy Salve addresses itching from every direction. It takes away the irritation and soreness to cool, soothe and moisturize the skin while nourishing the roots.</p>
