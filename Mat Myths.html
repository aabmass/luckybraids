<p>Mats can be beneficial, but do not solve all equine issues. In fact, they can promote problems. However, with some awareness, you can optimize mats’ utility.</p>

<p>Mats are <strong>NOT</strong> a substitute for bedding. In fact, without ample bedding, they promote lameness. Rubber gets cold. That makes horses sore. How would you feel if you slept on a cold wet bed? You’d ache. Lots of bedding insulates, to keep horses comfy.</p>

<p>Some mats may not seem slippery. <strong>But:</strong> heads up. Be careful. You don't want your horse being unstable in the truck. Try watching when a horse gets up from a nap. His feet may slide too wide and strain. Have you ever known a horse to wake up lame? Sometimes they slip getting up on mats or get cast against the wall. Plenty of bedding can solve the sliding.</p>

<p>So, really deep bedding is most beneficial. It may seem counter-intuitive, but bedding deep and picking often will conserve bedding and dramatically CUT COSTS.<a href="http://www.luckybraids.com/edu/BeddingStatLR.pdf">Here’s</a> how bedding statistics perpetuate myths, as well as sound routines.</p>

<p>We all know a good night’s sleep makes a <strong>world</strong> of difference. Make it easy for your your horse to be successful.</p>
