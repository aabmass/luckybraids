<p><b>Pinned tails</b> make braiding tricky.</p>

<p>One the rare occasion that a horse resists, or questions braiding by tensing as such, the solution is not to fight. You'll never win. Just relax your hands and wait. Soon the dock will relax.</p>

<p>Other options are to place your wet sponge under the tail or place a rolled a towel under the dock. I have also seen braiders use rulers and crops to hold the tail up. But, I would not recommend using something uncomfortable.</p>

<p>If the equine is the type to resist, they are also more apt to take action. Low impact solutions have always proven most effective for me.</p>
