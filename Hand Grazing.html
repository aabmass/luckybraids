<p><strong>HAND GRAZING Is this how you hand graze?</strong></p>

<p>Good grazing form minimizes risk for INJURY and DEATH. If a horse steps on the lead, he can strain himself as he realizes his head is locked down. If he gets foot through the halter, he'll break his neck. Is easy to imagine if you think of a horse rubbing his face leg and stomping at a fly. If the halter is too loose, he can put his hoof right through the noseband. If the halter is nylon, he'll definitely break his neck. Leather ones may not break. Most bathing halters are nylon. </p>

<p>So, pay mind:</p>
<p>PROPERLY FIT THE HALTER &amp; KEEP THE LEAD OFF THE GROUND.</p>

<p>Halters should be fitted so you can fit a good fist between the noseband and face, not more. This looks a bit tight, but might be fine when the mare puts her head up to measure the fit.</p>

<p>Horses are so happy to graze! Make sure yours stays safe and SOUND.</p> 

<p>This horse is the beloved Holiday 3E, ridden by Brooks Vardell. A big Top Turnout Salute to you! We love to see comfortable and safe horses! That's what allows them to develop the quiet confidence for big hearts that win.</p>
