<p><strong>LEADING</strong></p>

<p>People get lazy without realizing it could be lethal. I know of 2 people that died by leading horses with the end of the rope over their left shoulder. In both cases, the horse bolted unexpectedly. The lead hooked the person's neck and broke it. Dead. It is important to ALWAYS lead at the horse's shoulder. Teach your horses walk and jog with, NOT behind you.</p>


<p>There are many benefits to being able to see the horse and have leverage to adjust him. One is to keep an eye on the horse, his eye and ear. That way, you can anticipate and counter problems before they happen. This is pivotal to being able to have a quiet confident horse.</p>

<p>It is also very important NOT to wrap the lead around your hand. If the horse pulls, the coil will tighten and break your fingers or worse. The same goes for dog leashes. A better idea is to fold the lead and grasp around the center of the organized length.</p>

<p>This groom is in perfect form. Excellence is a way of Being and she is all about it. Check out the brass on the shank and fabulous fleece. The horse's eye is eager and relaxed. That makes for a big heart that wins. This team is turned out to the nines! I love it!</p>

leading, as well as wise shank usage.
Be safe and enjoy.</p>
