<p>These boots were getting wiped clean before the jump off, by the great groom Daniel. Rugs on floors wear out for being dirty, not traffic.</p>

<p>The same goes for horses' coats. Clean is resilient, provided you don't use products that strip or seal their coats. Most shampoos and detanglers do. So, groom well. You won't need many products or applications if you choose well. In the long run, a sound routine will save you time and money.</p>
