<p>THERE YOU HAVE IT: the hair only as long as my THUMB NAIL. Let those bridle paths grow! For English riding disciplines, other than gaited horses, bridle paths are a mechanism for organizing hair. They should only be as wide as your bridle. So, let it grow.</p>

<p>I PROMISE you can make it look good until you reach the growth goal.</p>

<p>Incidentallyâ€¦ if only had a dime for every bald guy that asked me if I cold braid his hair!</p>

<p>TRUTH: You can tie up almost anything.</p>

<p>CERTAINLY: Opt for the clean lines. Create them as best YOU CAN.</p>

<p>TIP: Tie up tiny braids right away. Don't let that hair think about straightening. Tie them up before the hair loosens.</p>

<p>I do this for short hairs near the withers and bridlepath. Usually we do one stage of the braiding process as a time. That is, we braid down, check the knots are in a perfect line, then tie up. However when braiding hair that is trying to grow out, tie it right up. After all, the goal is not to match the bottom line. It is to keep the hair managed well as it is in transition.</p>

<p>Top Turnout is about clean lines. So, get that short hair knotted up!

<p>I deliberately left the wispies, because I want you to see that I DO NOT CUT the hair. That would defeat the purpose. This is a good job. When you stand back, all YOUR EYE SEES is the CLEAN BOTTOMLINE of the braids. </p>

<p>If the hair is very wet and you have good technique, you'll do a fine job. Again, this is good work, given the hair was as long as my short thumbnail.</p>

<p>If you need that little something that allows you to consistently knock out gorgeous manes, you can learn it with the <a href="http://www.shinyhappyhorses.com/pages/video-preview">Lucky Braids DVD/Tool.</a> Sample the content. Even if you are a seasoned braider, you'll likely learn something in just the video trailer.</p>

<p>YOU CAN DO IT. Manage hair growing. Don't leave it breaking up your lines. Start the braid with yarn, just as we do to give support to the start of the forelock. Twist and tie it right up.</p>

<p>If you want your braids to sing, I can help you finesse the whole process. It can be quick, comfortable and consistently gorgeous. IT is NOT rocket science, just a braiding formula, complete with a finger form.</p>

<p>As with equitation, if your fingers are in a proper position, you can balance to the next movement. That efficiency is what makes braiding fast and even. The visual rhythm of the uniformity of the braids comes from a physical rhythm. So, it is important that you have a smooth and reliable system. Which, you can practice at home! It is all detailed in the <a href="http://www.shinyhappyhorses.com/collections/all/products/better-braiding-dvd">Lucky Braids DVD/Tool.</a> Anyone can learn to lay down stunning braids.
