<p><strong>SNARKY PONY SAVES THE NIGHT</strong></p>

<p>It was cold. The green grooms were not heeding my gracious suggestions to clothe the horses. The energy was so unsettled, I couldn't even braid. The horses were cold! Then...</p> 

<p>One pony is best known for his discerning sense of self. It manifests as his teeth intercept my line of motion. He makes me laugh, though. What a snare! He can wrinkle his nostril up with a glare like no other! It's a riot, and his baseline expression. Well…</p>

<p>Last night he tried to commit suicide. You can see in this picture that he dig holes, flung himself against the wall, rolled, dug more… HA. The grooms paid attention. They whipped out blankets for 22 horses, and all was well. Now…</p>

<p>I have to hand it to that pony. He COMMANDED respect, leaving me snickering. Ponies. Good job! Fortunately, I was there to translate for him, rather than him going the mile to full blown colic. When his turn came to get his hair twisted, he was so very sweet. AH.</p>

<p>I have known horses to make themselves sick for being too hot. You never want to overdress them. They'll stress themselves sick. Usually horses lie down to warm up. But, this pony decided conditions were off the charts. They were.</p>

<p>Once the grooms started thinking about it, they got excited to do the right thing. Talk was about how the horses are totally in their care they need to assure the animals' welfare. We can bundle up and sleep. They can't. Imagine how angry they'd be in the morning! Surely they'd dump the riders. Cold muscles are tight, so they'll go lame. The more the grooms considered the equation, the more delighted they were to do a good job. I was just a girl on a ladder. These were the horses they love.</p>

<p>It's worth mentioning the grooms are great guys. They're just inexperienced, without much leadership nor education.</p>

<p>If you know grooms that could use training in English or Spanish, that is my very favorite thing to do. I love to acknowledge how pivotal they are to the horses' well-being and success. Together, we share sound horsemanship techniques and routines to make their work efficient and excellent. As a result, everyone saves time and money, while conserving natural resources. Equipment gets and stays in great shape. Horses stay sounder. The barn runs smoothly. Grooms not only learn to think ahead of the horse, but also cultivate quiet, confident horses. So… they can have big hearts to win!</p>
