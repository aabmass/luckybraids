<p><b>Don't Cut</b> Hair</p> 

<p>When braiding, it is very tempting. But, if you cut, it will be worse next time. Truth is, the most important part of the braid job is the bottomline. If that's straight, your eye is drawn to it, so the wispies become insignificant. Why? If the line is straight, that is what your eye sees. So, wet the mane well to braid it, so hair locks in better. Then, resist temptation.</p>

<p>For more on how to make the hair fold into the braid smoothly, my technique is clearly visible and explained in detail in the 80 minute Lucky Braids DVD/Tool system<a href="http://luckybraids.com/products.htm.">here.</a></p>
