<p><strong>Top Turnout Clinics</strong> run 2-days, including demonstration and hands-on workshops.  Ruthann developed Top Turnout Clinics to teach the best care practices of elite horsemen to the masses.  Attendees learn about care, handling and safety that save time, money and soundness, while at the same time, making their horses hearts BIG to win.  Some topics include bathing faces so horses love it, pulling manes peacefully, eliminating scratches, promoting naturally full tails, seasonal coat care treatments, bandaging, trimming, braiding, adjusting hoof care to conditions, bathing without water and understanding non-toxic product options, etc. The first day takes place in a covered arena, with attendees sit in bleachers or in a theater made of bales.  On the second day we work at the end of a barn aisle set-up.  The 2 small hands-on workshops are an opportunity for one-on-one coaching from Ruthann for those students serious about braiding or bandaging well.</p>

<p><strong>Every horse and person</strong>, in every discipline and at every level will learn useful techniques during the demonstration that they'll use every day in the barn.  Attendees will leave skilled and excited to improve their grooming, handling and safety with cost-effective, healthy and simplified best care practices they'll use daily.  It is also super-helpful to have trainers to encourage their students to attend.   Doing so, they reduce their own liability, dazzle judges and enjoy more confident and sound horses.  Please encourage anyone with doubts to call Ruthann.</p>

<p><strong>Prerequisite</strong> for all hands-on braiders:  Master Ruthann's formula for thumb position and picking up the pieces as outlined in the DVD BEFORE attending the clinic.  That way, you can work on polishing your technique instead of thumb position in the clinic.  Please note: it is sometimes more difficult for seasoned braiders to change their habits.  If you are a good braider, it is all the more reason to be sure you have Ruthann's finger form down.  After all, braiding is like equitation: if you are in the proper position, it is easier to balance to the next movement.  That's how we can braid fast, get the braids even and have no cramped hands.  So, work on your position so the clinic can be gratifying.</p>

<p><strong>Sponsoring</strong> tack shops spotlight their business for promoting sound horsemanship as well as providing the service of making available valuable and previously coveted techniques of the most successful horsemen. Clinics sales include a range of grooming products as Ruthann outlines which best serve the horses' needs.  Tack shops often co-sponsor clinics with a club, association or stable.</p>
