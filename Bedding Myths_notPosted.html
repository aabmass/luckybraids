Some things you definitely don’t want left in the stall, such as nails and needles. A well-bedded stall is easy to work in and maintain.</p></div>

<p>	These green-conscious times are bringing forth new information, but: heads up. Some claim pellets and mats save on bedding. That may be true, but there are other important issues to consider in order to fully understand the impact of your choices on not only the environment but also horses’ soundness. This article will consider hidden costs, with the ideal being to go green and be the most cost-effective.</p>

<p>I watched horses sleep, as well as studied and conferred with world-class grooms for 30+ years, often 18 hours a day, from atop a ladder. I could see many horses in their stalls at any time. Teaching Top Turnout©™ Clinics, I travel to farms around the continent and have witnessed care patterns inconsistent with established truths.</p>

<p>If you want to conserve resources, reduce waste, lower vet bills, perform less work, and enjoy horses with bigger hearts, please consider this: </p>

<p><strong>• Mats can be dangerous without enough bedding.</strong> With most mats, horses slip getting up. Serious injuries can occur. Choose mats carefully.</p>

<p><strong>• Bedding lightly with pellets is not a viable substitute for bedding well.</strong>Wet or not, bedding less does not necessarily save. To greatly reduce bedding costs and disposal: bed deep and pick stalls often. It will save on time, too.</p>

<p><strong>• Bedding can promote soundness.</strong> Horses love deep fluffy beds. It is better for circulations. Plus, they can rest their bones instead of becoming stiff. Banked deep is generally considered best. They love a pillow.</p>

<p><strong>• Dry sleep is better.</strong> Sleeping in a damp stall promotes soreness and achiness. If a horse wets a lot, take it out before bedtime, and fluff the stall to reestablish an even bed with banks.</p>

<p><strong>• Read your bedding.
