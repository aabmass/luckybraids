<p>These green-conscious times are bring forth new information, but: heads up.  Some claim pellets and mats save on bedding. That may be true, but there are other important issues to consider in order to fully understand the impact of your choices on not only the environment but also horses’ soundness.  This article will consider hidden costs, with the ideal being to go green and be most cost-effective.</p.

<p>I watched horses sleep as well as studied and conferred with world-class grooms for 20 year, usually 18 hours a day, from atop a ladder. I could see many horses in their stalls at anytime. Teaching Top Turnout Clinics, I travel to farms around the continent and have witnessed care patterns inconsistent with established truths.</p>

<p>If you want to conserve resources, reduce waste, lower vet bills, require less work, and enjoy horses with bigger hearts, please consider this:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Mats can be dangerous without enough bedding. With most mats, horses slip getting up. Serious injuries can occur. Choose mats carefully.</li>

    <li>Bedding lightly with pellets is not a viable substitute for bedding well. Wet or not, bedding less does not necessarily save. To greatly reduce bedding costs and disposal: bed deep and pick stalls often.  It will save on time, too.</li>

    <li>Bedding can promote soundness. Horses love deep fluffy beds. They can rest their bones instead of promoting stiffness. Banked deep is generally considered best. They love a pillow.</li>

    <li>Read Bedding. Always look at the bedding to make sure your horse is not getting sick.</li>
</ul>


	<p><strong>Holes- </strong>Digging can indicate discomfort that can quickly lead to colic. And, while banks can reduce the number of horses that get cast, if a horse paws a gulley, it is apt to get stuck/cast.</p>
	
	<p><strong>Circling- </strong>Stall walking can also indicate discomfort.
	
	<p><strong>Manure- </strong>Always note a stall’s condition as you enter it. If a horse has not been passing enough manure, he is getting or already sick. I’d make sure he is drinking and take him for a walk, and consult with your trainer or vet.</p>


<br></br><h2><strong>Bedding for Big Hearts and a Green Earth</strong></h2>

<p>Here are tips for greatly reduced bedding costs and disposal:</p>

<p><strong>Skip Out- </strong>Pick stalls several times during the day.  The more often, the better.  It’s easier! The stalls never get dirty. No work and much less removal.</p>

<p><strong>Coop- </strong>If every one picks another’s stall, the shavings never get dirty. With most horses, you only need to take the wet in the morning.</p>

<p><strong>Clean Best- </strong>In my experience, proper process can reduce the amount of shavings you are using. You can have fluffy fresh shavings always by only taking out half a small wheelbarrow in the morning and a few dumps without bedding throughout the day and before bed. I see that as the best way to save on shavings: Never let them get dirty. The misconception is that this requires more work. It’s less!  Especially if the horses are handled well.</p>

<div class="figure"><a href="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0529/1857/files/SkippingOut_web.jpg?3697" target="blank"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0529/1857/files/SkippingOut_web.jpg?3697" 
alt="Skipping Out" style="float:right;margin:0 5px 0 0;"/></a></div>


<p><strong>Take Less- </strong>Only take out dirty shavings. Separate manure buns by sifting off shavings with the fork. Turn bedding daily by throwing it against the wall. Manure separates itself out as it rolls off the bank. Then, spread and bank the shavings.</p>

<p><strong>Use Less- </strong>If you bed light, you need to re-bed daily. If you bed deep, remove only dirty shavings and all manure, you only need to add only .5-1 bag a week. I like 10 bags in a standard stall. </p>

<p><strong>Win More- </strong>Picking saves shavings and allows for your horse to love his life. Nothing like a good night’s sleep! Especially, when he is not stiff! Not enough bedding can inhibit circulation. Imagine it: the big body is pressing on the ground. Without enough bedding, circulation is inhibited. Tired and sore parts are not replenished. Lactic acid stays in the muscle. Horses get sore- same as if the blankets don’t fit: Tight in the shoulders makes horses stiff. If they can’t get comfortable or move, they get sore. Disagreeable, even.</p>

<p><strong>Pick lots! - </strong>You’ll love the results. It only takes a minute. Save, conserve and reduce. In my experience, for the average barn, bedding well could reduce needs by 70 to 90%. And, even make horses hearts’ big. So, bed to win.</p>
