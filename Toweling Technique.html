<p>Can you see how the groom holds the towel transitions easily to the legs? Keeping legs CLEAN and DRY is ESSENTIAL to avoiding heel scratches, which can become a systemic infections in horses.</p>

<p>This toweling technique may seem insignificant. But, it is actually very high-minded. No energy is lost. I rather consider Beth a genius. Nothing is taken for granted.</p>

<p>There is always a better way. That is why I admire her so much. Now, let's peak a bit further. This is near the end of the dayâ€¦ Look at the floor. The bulging vein at the girth tells you the mare already worked. She had not been body clipped nor bathed.</p>

<p>Fungus is incredibly pervasive in Florida. So, if you look, you can see Beth keeps the hair on the lower leg a bit shorter. That way she can manage the skin better. Though, the transition to the clipped hair is absolutely seamless. The hooves are in great shape, and clearly never left dirty, as that would dry them out. Coolers and bottles are all in order. The groom's shirt is white, even at the end of the day. That speaks of super management skills. We had another groom friend who'd to wear all white on grand prix day, just to prove they were there to do it right. You can, too! </p>
