<p>Horsemen agree that it is preferable for a horse to break the cross-ties rather than injure himself. And, if the ties don't break, some- one will usually get hurt.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, most people have beliefs about cross-ties that are not based in truth. They are about what they think will happen, instead of what really does. This article will share the easiest and most effective safe cross-tie practices for every barn.</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Do not use baling twine.</strong> It can have different properties. And, I have never seen it break except for a strand that was at least 20 years old. For a number of reasons to follow, there are easier, more reliable and attractive solutions. Baling twine is out. Now we have better options that are also essentially free.</li>

    <li><strong>Refocus.</strong> If the safety breakaway is at the wall, when the horse shoots back, the tie whips around and hits everyone in the head. You can really get hurt. And, it spooks the horse into becoming defensive on the ties. If it does not break (most baling twine won't), the horse sits back and slips, likely straining something. In short, by planning the break at the wall, you are increasing the propensity for you and your horse to get severely hurt.</li>

    <li><strong>Break at the halter.</strong> If the breakaway is at the halter and works, you solve a lot. Usually the horse stops when one side breaks. So, he  is less apt to injure himself. And, the tie falls away from you and your horse. Avoid the snowball effect by putting the break at the halter.
    </p>

    <li><strong>Pick a side.</strong> While two breakaways are fine, one usually does the trick. When the horse starts to blow, just stand back. Most horses will stop when one side lets go. If I am braiding, I put the break on the right side, so it releases before knocking me off the ladder.</li>


    <li><strong>Keep it simple.</strong> The best answer is also the easiest. I like to use a medium weight cable tie. That's right, a ZIP TIE. It will break when it should. Plus, it looks neat when left on the halter. A great idea is to buy a big pack and give them away.</li>

    <li><strong>When you use yarn as a breakaway device, fold three pieces in half.</strong> Tie a loop onto the halter ring with three knots. Cut the fray for neatness. That loop will break well. Braiders use a yarn breakaway for tying horses in stalls with great success.
    </p>

    <li><strong>Leads should not break.</strong> Be sure to attach a leadline to the halter, not the breakaway. When leading, you want don't want your equipment to fail. Let go if you will, but if you have the rope, you don't want it to break loose. So, to lead, always snap to the halter, NOT the plastic or yarn.</li>

    <li><strong>Disconnect for passing.</strong> Regardless of any rationale, you should always disconnect one tie before another horse passes on the aisle. If you are trying to pass, please ask and wait for the person on the floor to unsnap the tie and move that horse over to the wall. Even if both horses get along, things happen. One day, something will make a noise and injuries will ensue. So, no short cuts: undo the cross-tie and move the horse to the wall before passing. It is a good habit.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<h2><strong>Grooming halters are great!</strong></h2>

<p><strong>For:</strong></p>

<p>–	Use in barn, on ties or in stall; not leading outside.</p>

<p>–	Easy, vigorous and relaxing face cleaning and toweling; feels good!</p>

<p>–	Avoiding injury. A worried horse usually runs backward. Without snow- balling panic and getting hurt, a horse will usually slip out of a well-fitted grooming halter easily enough. So, when the horse starts to sit back on the cross-ties, just step away and wait with a calm “whoa.” He generally won't go far when it releases. Then you can instill confidence and regroup.</p>
</blockquote>
<br></br>


<p>So, it is easy to create your safeties. I highly recommend cross-tying to a zip-tie on the halter. Even if the barn uses something at the wall, a plastic tie on your horse's halter, careful leading and passing on the aisle will serve you well.</p>
