<p>Lots of people are a little stressed out. So, here is a cute story of real love...</p>

<p>I watched this little team take a lesson over cross rails. The girl had no contact. The pony was smug. It was a riot. Sheer joy! They were both totally delighted. Then the adults, as they walked away, decided the slightly older brother should canter the pony, in order that she get some exercise. WELL! That was not in the program! I watched this pony then tear around sideways- running out through the shoulder, trying to ditch the boy on the fence- at all costs! I mean, really trying to eject him! No way! She liked her little girl and that was it. End of story. It really was her game and the mare knew it.</p>

<p>See, this is not a rotten pony, she just had a specific job description: gentle teacher and lover. Anything else got ruled out.</p>
<p><strong>Bottom line:</strong></p>

<p>Every horse has a ticket. We just need to figure out what works.</p>
