<p>When a horse puts his head down, the skin at the withers stretches most. Meanwhile, in most disciplines, top turnout involves crafting clean lines. So, you want to be sure to keep the horse comfortable, while braiding all the hair.</p>

<p>At the withers, braids closer together allow the skin to stretch more. If you make small braids and add the yarn to the front of and at the top of the braid, all the hair can be easily and comfortably braided. Usually I do one stage of the process at a time. That is, I braid it all down, pull it all up and then tie them. This helps develop a physical rhythm that yields a visual rhythm- more uniform braids.

</p> However, where hair is short, it helps to tie those braids up right away. Otherwise, they loosen. Try to get the bottom line as even as possible. The hair in this image is actually plenty long. I'd braid that section, check the knots make a clean line, then tie that section so it is even.</p>
