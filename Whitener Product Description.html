<p>This is not a bleach nor detergent, so it is much more versatile than a stain remover.  It is a revolutionary enzymatic formula, which simply dissolves the bond between hair and dirt. </p>

	<li>If <b>hooves</b> are soft, no hose is needed</li>  
	<li>When <b>cold</b>, instantly spray and wipe clean</li>

</ul>

<h2>Best Use</h2>

<p><b>Spray area.</b> On normal urine, manure and tack stains, impurities instantly bead up or start to run.  Then, wait a moment and simply wipe clean with a towel.  No scrubbing needed.</p>

<p>For <b>tough old stains</b>, keep in mind that when the enzyme dries, it dies.  So, spritz the area.  Make sure it gets in between hairs.  Let sit.  You may need to re-apply if hair was dried out/ stains penetrated deeply.</p>

<p>For badly <b>stained tails</b>, spray and tie them up.  With less surface area, they stay damp longer, so the enzyme can do its action.   Keep sprizing the knot as needed.</p>

<h2>Good News for Tough Stains</h2>

<p>Once ahead of old stains, it will be much easier to keep horses clean.  Going forward, the hair will not attract impurities as before.</p>

<p>Note: with Lucky Braids All-In-One Shampoo, horses stay cleaner longer.</p>
