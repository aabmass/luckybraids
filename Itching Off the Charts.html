<p>This horse had been trying to commit <b>suicide</b> for months. You can see where he chewed a hole in his knee and his shoulder. The knee had been a small sand infection, but he kept at it. Collars and other apparatuses made no difference. The farriers told me he'd just stand and chew on or knock the knee on the wall all day. The poor guy kept throwing himself against walls, miserably scratching without relief. A highly respected vet had diagnosed him with allergies to many things in the barn. For months he had been actively treated with meds, topicals and shampoos. The vet visited him on a daily basis, personally dressing the knee, which he continued to bang on walls. </p>

<p>The grooms were distraught. He was NOT getting better. 
</p>

<p>The gelding's coat was totally depleted. No shine. He was SO DRY. Of course his skin would be irritated. Now, the meds could have made the skin worse. I see that a lot. Bottom line, parched skin is defenseless. Since Lucky Braids All-In-One Shampoo gently kills irritants while MOISTURIZING and SOOTHING skin… and all other treatments to date had failed him… the grooms decided to try it.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the bath, every time the groom even lifted the sponge, the horse pushed toward it, desperately trying to scrape his body. By the end of the bath, his head was down, eye soft and he was mouthing, the ultimate expression of relaxed submission. The farriers saw it happen as well. There was no denying something wonderful had come to pass. We were so excited. I could not even sleep that night. What joy! I was SO HAPPY he could finally relax, comfortable in his skin.
</p>

<p>That was it. No more itching. This is a happy horse once again.
</p>

<p>I might not have believed it, had I not witnessed it. 
</p>

<p>Lucky Braids All-In-One Shampoo is just that: all you need.
