<p>Braiding yarn is pivotal. Without the proper properties, you cannot achieve a perfectly clean BOTTOMLINE to the braids, which is the MOST IMPORTANT ELEMENT of any braid job, regardless of how you tie them up. Plus some yarn hurts your hands. With Lucky Braids Yarn, you can comfortably and quickly make gorgeous braids that last.</p>
