<p>No one wants to look like they are wearing a wig. The best way to care for extensions is to keep them clean, without stripping them. Don't use detangler or shine sprays or gels. It can discolor them, as will harsh shampoos. Given that is what most people do, here is what I recommendâ€¦</p>

<br /><h2><strong>Cleaning</strong></h2>

<p>These tails are not going to generate the all important natural oils. They are pivotal because oils help the hair stay clean, shine and not break. The only product I know that will gently clean, while adding protective oils is Lucky Braids All-In-One Shampoo.</p>

<p>You want to COMB TAILS WHILE WET. It is relatively easy with the Lucky Braids Shampoo, which is conditioning (Truly all-in-one!). Then, when it dries, the tail will be big and fluffy. Hair will stay separated rather than make ringlets. Crazy and true. Same goes for the natural tail. <a href="http://www.shinyhappyhorses.com/pages/tail-tips">Here are the details.</a>
</p>

<br /><h2><strong>Storing</strong></h2>

<p>Don't wrap the tails in trunks nor leave them braided. It makes the hair yucky and weak. Instead, organize the hair and let them hang loose. When you need to travel, I'd just lay them neatly inside the top of trunks. 
</p>


<p>If you don't want to bathe, but need to get dust or mud out of a tail, an enzyme made for horses can dissolve the bond with the dirt without drying out or coating the hair. Doing so would make the hair brittle and prone to breakage. Lucky Braids Whitener/Dry Wash Spray takes good care of ANY COLOR HAIR. I was short sighted when I named it, as it is not a bleach or detergent. All the spray does is separate the dirt from the hair. Let it sit a minute and wipe it off with a towel. Old stains need to soak a bit. When it dries, it dies, so let it sit and stay damp to work on the stain if need be. 
</p>

<p>The most cost effective way to buy it is in our quart spray bottle, then refill gallons. Use our spray bottle as it is opaque. Light could damage the enzyme.
