<p>DON’T DO IT. I understand the temptation. But, there are far more reasons NOT to buzz a big mane. Here are a few of them:
</p>

<p>1.	Hair will grow back like WIRE. If you think the mane unmanageable now, just you wait. There is no turning back once you clip the mane. It grows back very coarse and straight- like wire.
</p><p>2.	Hair growth will push the rest out of place. Even when freshly clipped, the mane will not lay flat. Braids will never be stable. The same goes for if you use a blade that cuts the mane at the crest. In my experience, Solo Combs and the like make braiding well impossible. Loose manes never sit properly, either. 
</p><p>3.	Braids have no solid anchor. The base (edge to edge of the crest) will not be there to hold braids still on nor flush to the neck. There will be no maintaining a clean bottomline, the most important part of the braid job. 
</p>

<p>Unless you are playing polo or working cattle out on the range, roaching any part of the mane is counter productive. Trust me. So that is does not grow back all at once, your best option is to thin the mane by pulling a little bit at a time, over a long period of time. I understand this is controversial. Please understand that I have peacefully pulled hundreds of thousands of manes. There is a way to do it. Most are not privy.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, most people inadvertently teach horses to resist thinning. Hold on. I can hear the uproar. Consider this: Have you ever noticed it hurts to pull your hair, but not to pluck your eyebrows? Not all hair is the same. Unless a horse has had a REALLY bad experience, you can get it to relax while thinning its mane. YES: relax. I actually do mean that they will fall asleep. Other pro braiders will attest.</p>

<p>Pulling well is a *management issue*. All top braiders agree that only less than 4% of horses even question pulling. If you are skilled, it can be non-invasive. <a href="http://www.shinyhappyhorses.com/pages/peaceful-mane-pulling">Here are some key points</a> for thinning manes peacefully.</p>

<p>To simply shorten manes, I tease and cut the bottom with the big Oster 84 AU blade. It has NO sharp edges that will cut anything but hair.
</p>

<p>START NOW. Getting a mane in good shape for braiding can take time. So, read that link and tick away at it.
