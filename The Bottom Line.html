<p>There is <b>only one straight line.</b> Achieving that bottomline is the primary goal of a braid job. Rollercoaster toplines need not be a problem. </p>


<p>Think of the <b>BOTTOMline</b> at each stage of the process. If the bottom of the mane, knots and folds of the braid are all ins straight line, so too will be the braids.</p>

<p>That means the mane and braids will be longer in an arch and shorter in a dip of the crest.
</p>

<p>Remember: the line BELOW the mane is the most important to craft. When it is dead straight, it draws your eye to it and down the neck, whereby enhancing conformation.
