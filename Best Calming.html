<p><stong>RUBBING EYES</strong></p>

<p>The most relaxing and pleasurable thing you can do for your horse is to rub his eye. It ALWAYS makes them melt. The most fearful aggressive instantly turn into buttercups.</p>

<p>It's simple: Softly cup the palm of your hand over the eyeball and rub back and forth. I put a little more pressure on the bone, toward the duct side. Relax your hand. Spend some time there.</p>
<p>If the horse does not understand what you are doing, he may pull back at first. Just stay relaxed and try again. Within seconds, he'll drop his head. When you stop, the eye will be all dreamy. This is super handy to get ANY HORSE INSTANTLY CALM AND CENTERED. I am telling you: They turn to buttercups!</p>
