<p>A BAD IDEA is talk on a PHONE while on mounted, never mind while crossing the street! You never know! Cars backfire, crash, etc. Horses push for home. Just don't do it. Be smart. Keep connected with your horse. A girl got airlifted from this path a few weeks ago. When there are two hospitals within 3 miles and you get airlifted out.... not good. 
Not advisable. NOT necessary. This is not recommended under any circumstances. Safety first. Thank you.</p>
