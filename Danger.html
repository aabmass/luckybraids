<p>A <b>bad idea</b> is talk on a phone while on mounted, never mind while crossing the street! You never know! Cars backfire, crash, etc. Horses push for home. Just don't do it.</p>

<p>Be smart. Keep connected with your horse. A girl got airlifted from this path a few weeks ago. When there are two hospitals within 3 miles and you get airlifted out.... not good. Not advisable. <b>NOT</b> necessary. This is not recommended under any circumstances. Safety first. Thank you.</p>
