<p>Moldy grain can be lethal. Be sure to clean all the old grain out of your bin or barrel before refilling it.</p>

<p>When feeding, don't dump new grain on old. Note that the horse did not eat, especially if it is unusual. That could be a sign the horse is getting sick or needs his meds managed differently. Toss what was not eaten. It is a good idea to scrub feed tubs and water buckets with dish soap once a week.</p>
