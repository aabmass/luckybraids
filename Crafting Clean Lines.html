<p>A wet brush and tail bandage can do wonders.</p>

<p>We used to always bandage tails of jumpers and dressage horses in the morning, before showing. When hair above the point of the rump lays flat and straight, it enhances the hind end.</p>

<p>I think it really polishes off the look. So much work and money goes into getting to the ring.</p>

<p>Why not choose to look like a million bucks? </p>
