<p><strong>CLOSE STALL DOORS</strong></p>

<p>When horses get loose, they often look to run home- into the barn. If a stall door is open a crackâ€¦ forget about it! The horse figures there is safety and hay inside. He'll try to run in, regardless of how wide the door is open. So, you run the risk of the horse's side and/or hip getting ripped open.</p>

<p>AS A RESULT of getting hurt, the pony or horse will forever bolt through doors. Then, one day, someone unsuspecting will get trampled. Your best strategy is to ALWAYS LEAVE STALL DOORS CLOSED- ALL THE WAY.</p>
