<p>Earshy hhorses are afraid you <strong>might</strong> touch their ears. Doing so takes away the anticipation!</p>

<p>Often horses getting braided just had their ears trimmed. Some have questions. The best thing to do is angle your arm to lean on the ear a bit. Keep steady pressure. Then, they don’t worry that you might touch the ear.</p>

<p> Easy.</p>
