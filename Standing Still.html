<p><strong>STANDING STILL</strong></p>

<p>Whether to ground tie, cross-tie or be braided, teaching a horse to stand still is simply a matter of timing. You want to intercept the horse's thought. Once he has moved, he is thinking of other things. In my experience, any horse can learn to stand still within a few minutes, usually without even touching him.</p>

<p>The key is watch for when he thinks about moving. That is, when he begins to shift his weight or focus his ear on something. In that moment, a quick visceral growl or hiss will plant his feet. Don't be mean. Just mean it. If you can get his attention this way, JUST as he begins to think about moving … and do that well three times in a row… then he has learned you want him to stand still.</p>
<p>Be consistent with your corrections. Growl from deep in your belly or give a quick hiss like a angry snake to divert his attention. The more well timed, consistent corrections you make, the quicker the learning curve. </p>

<p>If he does move, put him back where you want him. Then, simply relax your hand. Patting can be distracting. Just hold in the desired spot and relax the hand that moved him. He'll feel that good energy as a clear reward and settle down. Then, as needed and without emotion, use the quick visceral sound to remind him where he belongs JUST AS he considers options.</p> It may be that no one ever asked the horse to do nothing before. So, as always, keep tuned in.</p>

<p>Standing still is not just a matter of convenience. It is teaching the horse to relax. Once achieved, your horse will be able to focus and be more confident under saddle as well. That is what Lucky Braids are. If during preparation, you get the horse's head clear and body relaxed, he can have a big heart to win.</p>
