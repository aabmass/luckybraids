<p>Effective treatment for the worst: scratches, itching, nicks, bites, scrapes, rubs, sores, galls, etc. Handy Salve quickly solves problems from every direction by: reducing inflammation, soothing, cooling, moisturizing and nourishing roots, skin and hair.</p>

<p>Handy Salve has proven the only effective relief for the <b>worst</b> scratches, tail <b>rubbers</b> boot rubs, *dogs with <b>hot spots</b>, etc.  </p>

<p>Most remedies are greasy or drying. So, they clog pores, attract the drying sun as well as fungus and bacteria, which can exasperate problems.  Many kill cells, actually inhibiting healing.  Stripping natural oils and parching skin leaves it even more susceptible to irritation and disease.  So, there may be relief for a minute, but the problem is perpetuated.</p>

<p>Handy Salve, on the other hand, promotes rapid healing by soothing and fortifying the skin. It’s the consistency of a light lotion.  Readily absorbed into the skin, it leaves no residue.  A good all-around topical, long-standing problems typically have hair growing back in 3-4 days.</p>

<p>The idea is for Lucky Braids Handy Salve to break the cycle and All-In-One Shampoo keep you out of the loop.</p>

<p style="font-size:small;">*You don’t want canines to eat the Salve.  It soothes instantly and is readily absorbed by the skin.  So, apply it and go for a walk or hold its head for a few minutes.  Then, wipe area clean.</p>
