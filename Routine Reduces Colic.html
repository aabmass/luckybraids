<p>Horses thrive on ROUTINES. The greatest horsemen I know are adamant about strict schedules, especially for feeding. The thought is that horses stress out otherwise. That could promote colic and/or ulcers. The big issue is, if the horse knows what to expect, he can settle in and be happier. When a horse is CONFIDENT about his program, he can feel safe enough to excel at his job.</p>

<p>Kim Prince runs one of the best operations I have ever known. One aspect is that the horses eat breakfast at 5:30, even at home. That way, shows are not a disruption to their program. One of her staff gets up to feed breakfast. The other grooms stay to feed dinner. Of course, sometimes showing is not done by dinnertime. That brings me to the next point.</p>

<p>All horses should be fed at the same time, so they don't stress about others getting to eat. You also want to be sure horses get hay first and a good hour to digest before working. If someone is still showing at the end of the day, only feed when that horse is out of the barn. If that one gets fed later, the others will already be full, and likely still munching on day, so it won't be a big deal to them. Or, feed everyone dinner later. Just work the routine so it as close to consistent as possible.</p>

<p>This pic is of my dear old friend, Corbeau. He was a riot- always ready for a party! Every time I came down the aisle, no matter the time of day, he had his head out. My Beau was ripe ready to play and love at any moment. Every moment! His turned lip indicates he was soliciting fun here. Anyway, this is the only pic I have of him. So, I was delighted to take this opportunity to share him with you.</p>
