<p>An ALTERNATIVE to braids....BIG HAIR and the BEAUTY of concealing nurturing. Nothing beats nature. So, how can we <b>work with it</b> for huge tails and manes?</p>

<p>This is a technique that comes from reiners. If you think about it, on the whole, western pleasure horses leave tails braided but need fakes. Reiners have huge tails. Here's why…</p>

<p>This is a figure 8 knot. The image is of an extra big for viewing ease. Successful grooms make several of these to sit at the base of the dock (tail bone). A huge tail may have about 18 or less. If they are too small or pulled tight, the turn of the hair prevents oils from sliding down. So, leave them in lightly. No taping or tightening. Loose. That way, you can leave them in a few days.</p>

<p><b>Here is the BEAUTY of this.</b> If just the long hair is pulled up into the knots at the base of dock… the shorter hair can fall over the knots. SO, the tail LOOKS natural. You should not see the figure 8s. The hair flows. It looks like nothing is going on! Gorgeous. Smart. I love that.</p>
