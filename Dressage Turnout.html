<h2><strong>Presentation</strong></h2>
<p>Your horse’s turnout speaks volumes about your knowledge of and respect for horses and the sport. So, let’s be sure you are sending the intended message. If you look like you know what you are doing, the judge will believe you, at least for the first few important strides.</p>
<p><strong>Tack Tip: </strong>As a daily routine, first, wipe sweat and dust off your tack with a clean damp sponge. Heads up: too much water makes foam, which can dry out leather. Be sure to squeeze all the water out of the sponge before applying soap. Then, use glycerin soap and water to clean and protect. Cellulose kitchen sponges hold less water than conventional tack sponges. Daily care takes only a few minutes, but it will preserve the tack and keep britches clean. For shows, polish the metal.</p>

<h2><strong>Daily Habits</strong></h2>
<p>Should you strive for excellence, know that each act adds up. Groom well and consistently at home. You are always establishing your standard to yourself and others. For instance, walking around with shavings in the tail or having a messy work area screams mediocrity or less. Always think ahead and be de- tail-oriented.</p>

<h2><strong>Line</strong></h2>
<p>We create the illusion of longer lines by making them clean and crafting their angle. A smooth line appears longer than a curved or broken one. Thin seems longer than thick. We create elegance by playing with perception to lengthen the lines of the horse and rider. For example, dressage riding boots should be super shiny and extra tall, even covering the side of the knee for a longer-looking leg.</p>
<p>Manes are braided to enhance length and roundness. The most important element of braiding is the bottom line. If you were to play connect-the-dots along the bottom of the braids, they should make a perfectly straight line. In this way, effective braids compensate for irregularities in the topline as well as the hairline. Size and relationship of the braids is also important. A few clumpy braids do not carry your eye down the neck – they break it up. You want a proportion and visual rhythm to lengthen the line. Today’s warmbloods generally do well to look more refined. Plus, the horse should be able to bend comfortably. The horse can’t stretch well with really big braids. Doorknob-size braids are not advisable, regardless of what you may have seen. Ideally, the angle is pitched so the braids are longer toward the poll than at the withers. This closes off the throatlatch a bit for refinement, as well as making the neck rounder when collected.</p>
<p>The cardinal sin is braids that jiggle. They defy the dressage ideal of clean, controlled movement, as can a loose forelock.</p>
<p>When considering styles of braids, remember our objective – a long, clean line. The speckled effect of white yarn cannot achieve the goal. White tape is passé. Now we can achieve a clean line without it, and international horses have not shown with it for several years. Button braids can be very attractive and effective. Nonetheless, three U.S. dressage
team riders and a national team coach have told me they prefer braids that lie flush to the neck, but are limited by their grooms’ skills. While dressage is Eurocentric, the braiding craft has not had the same opportunity to evolve in Europe. In the U.S., we have specialists who braid day and night for decades on end. These professionals have advanced techniques, and style has followed to maximize impact. However, braiding well is not rocket science. You can learn a tried-and-true formula to yield consistently beautiful braids quickly, with no cramped hands.</p>
<p>Long manes are suitable for Iberian and Friesian horses. Braiding them also involves employing a clean line to lengthen and refine the neck, although the angle is reversed. Since skin stretches more toward the withers, and necks tend to be thick, the line of the braid can thin the neck, while allowing comfortable flexing. Loose ends flying, or a braid that buckles over the crest, break the line rather than achieve our goals. Yet, with some technique, big hair can be managed beautifully.</p>
<p><strong>Long Mane Tip: </strong>Keep the head up while braiding so the
line is optimal when the horse is collected. Finish braiding with ample time before tacking up so the horse can relax while remaining tied up with water. Putting his head to the ground could pull out hair.</p>
<p>Dressage tails are thinned at the top to make the hind end look powerful, yet shapely. To make the hind end look stronger, yet elegant, the top of the tail should be “pulled.” As with manes, “pulled” is an umbrella term for shortening and thinning. A bushy top makes the horse look chunky and unkempt. Traditionally, hair is teased with fingers and then pulled out, which does not hurt. I have never had a horse even flinch. Clipping the sides is an option if you do not want to keep up on pulling. You’ll still want to thin some of the front so it does not splay laterally and break the line. Bandaging with a damp cotton AceTM bandage before the class will flatten hair to add definition.</p>
