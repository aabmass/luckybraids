<p><strong>WET BRUSH to straighten manes.</storng></p>

 This horse was assembling for the Winter Equestrian Festival Parade of Circuit Champions- Perhaps one of the most important photo opp's of this horse's career. A wet brush would have done wonders. Shoot for top turnout.</p>

<p>It is actually easier to do things wellâ€¦ 
When hair is left braided or kinked, natural oils don't readily move down the strands to enrich and protect them. That's why leaving braids in overnight makes hair brittle to break. Even if horses don't rub, there is little left to twist by the end of season. Do you know someone with frizzy hair that is dry and brittle? Kinks in manes and tails represent the same dynamic.</p>
