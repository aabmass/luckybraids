<p>An <b>updo</b> can keep horses' tails clean before showing. This can impress judges, as well as keep the tail healthier. Mud is drying. So, dirty tails get brittle to break.</p>

<p>Here are some tips:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Here you see the braider bandaged the tail with a cotton ace. Then, the groom pulled up the length with another bandage. Using two bandages dissipates the pressure. That is less pressure on the hair in the braid, which I recommend.
</li><li>No polo bandages on braids. They slip, which breaks hair. The length maybe be in a polo, but a polo is a very last resort for covering the braid.
</li><li>If your horse wears a fake tail, I would definitely put it up while schooling in the mud. You don't want that heavy wet hair hanging on the dock more than necessary. 
</li><li>If the tail were unbraided, I would still put it up until right before showing. Why not look like a million bucks?!
</li><li>Young horses should practice at least once at home. Having the tail up or braided is a different weight. So, let your equine trot around at home to feel and realize it is not a problem. At some point he should settle down and stop swishing/questioning the tail. There are enough new things for green horses at shows. A simple exercise like this can be wise miles under his belt. 
</li><li>If tails or legs are muddy ringside, you can get them sparkling clean instantly without drying the hair nor skin. Lucky Braids Whitener/Dry Wash Spray works on <b>ANY COLOR.</b> This enzyme for equines dissolves the bond with dirt, leaving hair super clean and without residue. Dirt and stains wipe off with a towel. 
</li>
</ul>

<p>So, set your horse up for success. A little management can keep horses sound of body and mind.</p>
