<p>All-In-One Shampoo is all you’ll need. </p>

<p>It does the work of: daily, anti-fungal, anti-itch, anti-bacterial, whitening and color shampoos, conditioners, detanglers, shine agents, and scratches medication, with superior results.  Most shampoos use salt (sodium chloride).  They strip natural oils, parching skin and leaving coats prone to skin disease.  Plus, the dry porous hair is thirsty- grabbing onto everything.  So, stains penetrate.  Lucky Braids Shampoo fortifies coats.  It nourishes and moisturizes skin and hair.  One bath not only leaves skin more resilient.  Hair stays cleaner longer.</p>

<p> Since we use only the finest, PHARMACEUTICAL-GRADE of nature’s best antiseptic anti-fungal TEA TREE OIL, horses bathed with Lucky Braids enjoy no scurf, crud, dander, rainrot, itching nor scratches (as long as you dry legs before putting them in a stall, of course).  It also makes braiding clean manes and clipping easier.  Horses bathed every 5-7 days, tend not to get ticks nor bothered as much by bugs.</p>

<p>Economical concentrate rinses clean and fast.  Plus, you won’t need to buy, manage or ship so many products.  With Lucky Braids All-In-One Shampoo, the highest quality care can be easiest and most cost-effective.</p>

<p> DOGS love it, too!  Skin is soothed.  Rinsing is quick.  Coats dry fluffy.</p>

<p><b>Tail Tip:</b> Comb clean tails while wet.  To protect the roots, twist the length and hold the bottom.  Using a fat comb, always start from the bottom as you work your way up the wet tail.  Organize hair to roots.  Tails dry full and floaty, while resisting tangles.  NO expensive detanglers or conditioners are needed.
