<p>Here's the thing. I've talked to MANY chemists about conditioners. The conversation ALWAYS hinges on how they get something to stick to the hair. I don't want something to stick to the hair! Why clog pores and weigh down a horse's tail??! A tail that falls like dead weight is not healthy nor appealing to me. Plus, you can't hold it to braid! Ugh.</p>

<p>I admire tails that are super FULL NATURALLY and FLOW. They enhance the hind end. Plus, if hair has a lot of motion, it pulls the natural oils down the shafts to enrich and strengthen hair. Then, the cycle is: BETTER GROWTH. : )</p>

<p>MY idea of “conditioning” is to IMPROVE the ACTUAL CONDITION of the hair AND skin/roots. That has nothing to do with leaving a smooth residue. I prefer to never strip oils, instead aiming to ENHANCE them. That is why the All-In-One Shampoo contributes oils to truly moisturize and nourish hair and skin.

<p>What we have discovered is that tails can actually be healthier AND EASIER to maintain without the extra step of adding conditioner. If you use the right shampoo, and COMB TAILS WHILE WET, they tend NOT to tangle. Imagine being able to just shake shavings out for a week!
</p>

<p>This time of year, many tails are transitioning from “BENIGN NEGLECT” to the SHOW RING. So, for the first bath of spring, you may choose to use a conditioner. Getting through it for the first time, I still I prefer that over detanglers, which just coat the hair with silicone. However, if you take your time with a big comb, you could be successful with just the Lucky Braids All-In-One Shampoo.
