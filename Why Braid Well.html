<p>I do think every rider should learn to braid well, for many reasons:</p>

<ul>

<li>Sound horsemanship
</li><li>Great skill to have in your back pocket: You can pick up good money at shows. Braiding is a great way to feed the horse habit. 
</li><li>Competitive advantage- impress judges and competition. If they can't help but look at how pretty and proficient, the judge thinks: This will be good. 
</li><li>Prepares horse and rider mentally for competition- time to gel 
</li><li>Can't always find a great and reliable braider- why trot in all and relax those circles and hike all that equipment to have the braider be a no-show?
</li><li>Make sure the preparation vibe stays good.
</li><li>Beautiful braids level the playing field. They earn instant credibility.
</li><li>Perfect bottomline is not only stunning, but also make the horse appear appear straighter, rounder and more balanced. 
</li><li>I was pro at 9 y/o and have always worked for myself.
</li><li>For less than the price of two manes braided, you can learn to make really </li><li>Now anyone can learn to braid like a top professional.

</ul>

<p>Like <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Michael-R-Matz/112891458724898">Michael R. Matz </a>said to me, “Braiding is a little thing, but all those little things add up.” Braiding well is sound horsemanship. All the greats used to master braiding as an integral part of sound horsemanship. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/peter.wylde">Peter Wylde</a> braided his own horse at the Olympics. It was part of his program that got him a gold medal.</p>

<p>The proven best way to learn the streamline formula for consistently gorgeous braids, quickly and comfortably is to study and practice the finger form I advocate.
