<p><strong>BRAIDING YARN</strong></p>

<p>To craft a perfectly straight bottomline to the braids, you need a yarn that is at once strong, stretches and holds its shape when wet. It is a real bummer to braid the whole mane down, only to have yarn pull apart when you try to tie up braids.</p>

<p>Most yarn is made for knitting/how it comes together, not how hard you can pull on it. Stretching allows the yarn to get thin and embed itself in the grain of the braid. It also lets you finely tune the bottomline. Plus, smaller knots means braids can sit flush to the neck.</p>

<p>If the yarn loosens when the horse sweats or gets a bath, there is no hope for maintaining a clean bottomline throughout the day's activities. So, you need to choose your Braiding Yarn carefully. That's why I developed one. With Lucky Braids' you need not worry.</p>
