<p>Pulling manes is a skill  you might ponder, dabble... or  fight  with. Pulling  well  is a foundation  of good turnout. It can earn you credibility in an aesthetic; competitive sport. It also makes braiding and banding well much easier.  Like braiding and banding, a good pull job makes the horse look more attractive by creating a clean  line on the neck. It's fashionable in many disciplines, tidy, and beautiful. Pulling well can even be an opportunity to have a gentle and confidence-building experience with your horse.</p>

<p>This article will discuss turnout of manes, thinning versus shortening techniques, and effective handling tips.</p>

<br></br><h2><strong>Fashion</strong></h2>

<p>"Shortened" manes are referred to as "pulled" manes. However, the term "pulling" is used loosely. Sometimes we actually pull the hair out to thin the mane. Other times we just shorten it, depending on the mane.</p>

<p>Whether you show with your horse's mane down, braided or banded, pulling the mane is another tool to create an optical illusion - a new line on the neck that makes it look more attractive. A straight line compensates fot the irregularities in the horse's conformation. If the mane is angled slightly (less than an inch) longer toward the poll than the withers, it closes off the throat latch a bit to give a more refined look. The angle also helps the neck appear slightly rounder and much longer. For best results, the mane should lie flat to articulate the line.</p>

<p>It's proper to pull the manes of many disciplines of horses: hunters, jumpers, field hunter, dressage, combined driving, draft, combined training and racehorses. However, many exhibitors showing in primarily breed shows opt to leave the mane natural.</p>

<br></br>
<h2><strong>Function</strong></h2>

<p>Pulling manes is utilitarian as well as stylish. Its neatness lends an air of competence to the competitive horse. It also keeps hair out of the reins. Manes are pulled so they stay orderly, enhance the horse's conformation, and are efficiently braided or branded.</p>

<p>I like my manes about 4 to 5 inches long - shorter for thin manes and longer for thick manes and jumpers. Manes too short are troublesome to train to lie flat and braid.</p>

<br></br>

<h2><strong>No More Tears</strong></h2>

<p>Truth is, horses do not feel pain when you pull their hair out. They don't have the nerve endings at their roots that people do. Therefore, pulling the mane out need not be uncomfortable or difficult. Nonetheless, handling of the horse can have everything to do with the horse's ability to relax and have a constructive experience. Certainly, no one wants to get hurt and the horse should not get upset before competing.</p>

<br></br>

<h2><strong>Training Manes</strong></h2>

<p>In order for a pulled mane to make a good impression, it needs to lie flat on the neck. Manes often require a little training and maintenance to comply. Most disciplines of horses consider it proper for the mane to lie on the right side od the neck. To train a mane to lie flat on one side, wet and braid it. Leave the tight braids in overnight. If it still doesn't lie over on the proper side, braid it again. Another trick is to rest a damp towel over the crest while the horse is standing on cross ties. This lends wight and moisture to help keep hair flat on the neck. It's always a good practice to wet brush the mane over at each grooming. The top grooms place a dry towel over the crest daily and pull down on it as they slide it over the crest, to the side of the mane. This gets all the hair lying straight ond flat. It's done before each ride. If you make a habit out of these practices, your horse's mane will always lie on the proper side and flat.</p>

<br></br>
<h2><strong>When to Thin, When to Shorten</strong><h2>

<p>Let's consider when to pull the hair out and when to just shorten it. If a mane is thick overall, it needs to have hair extracted to lie flat or braided beautifully. Big braids look clumpy when they sit on the neck and are too difficult to pull tight. Think refined and proportional. Braids should present a visual rhythm in their uniformity, rather than look like a braided rug with braids touching each other. Really tick manes should be thinned over a period of time. If you pull too much at once, it will all grow in at once, making it more difficult to lie flat and braid. Pulling should be done little by little.</p>

<p>If a mane is thick in a pot, thin that section to make the mane more even. The exception to this rule is when the mane is very thin and you need every hair to squeeze enough braids in. Nonetheless, if the mane is average and thick in sections, pull hair out from the thick sections. The more uniform the thickness of the mane, the easier it is to make the mane look even, whether it's down or braided.</p>

<p>When shortening the mane without needing to extract hair, remember that the mane 
should be tapered, not blunt at the bottom.  Don't use scissors- they make the mane 
too blunt.  Blunt hair falls in unnatural sections, won't maintain a clean bottom line, 
and works against knots to loosen up braids.</p>

<br></br>
<h2><strong>Tools</strong></h2>

<p>I like to use a "people comb" to thin the manes.  My favorite is a plastic comb with a 
handle.  If you need to use the tradition metal pulling comb, you are pulling too much 
hair at once and will be creating other problems.</p>

<p>To shorten the mane, the best tool is a big body clipper blade It's easiest to be 
accurate with this implement.  Most barns have a box of them that need to be 
sharpened.  Theses are fine.  Recycle.</p>

<br></br>

<h2><strong>Pulling Techniques</strong></h2>

<p>Remember, the bottom line of the mane should be straight, slightly longer toward the 
poll than the withers and tapered at the bottom.  When pulling, have the horse hold its 
head as it would in the ring.  If it drops its head too far, when it lifts its head the 
bottom line of the mane will curve.</p>

<p>Since the horse shows with its head up, have the bottom line straight in that position.  
Now lets consider different skills for thinning and shortening.</p>

<br></br>

<h2><strong>Thinning</strong></h2>

<p>Thinning a mane is not difficult.  The knack lies in pulling out small numbers of hair at 
a time to get the mane even and the horse to understand that you are not doing 
something invasive, regardless of how defensive it might be.</p>

<p>Read the mane.  Get a sense for if the mane is thicker in any particular area, or 
overall.  That's where you'll want to thin.</p>

<h2><strong>Handling Tips</strong></h2>
<p>Many horses resist having their manes pulled.  They may not like the idea or they have 
had a bad experience.  All of this comes down to making the horse comfortable and 
instilling confidence.</p>

<p>If a horse is fearful, the key is to work slowly and gently.  Sometimes the horse just 
wants to know you are not challenging it.  Lots of good, short experiences teach the 
horse pulling need not be traumatic.</p>

<p>If a horse is indignant, be clear.  Consistent.  Not argumentative, clear.
The most effective mode of correction is to counteract the horse's thought rather than 
movement.  Be tuned in.  Look for shifts in weight or an ear refocusing.  Intercept 
promptly.</p>

<p>If a horse resists having its mane thinned here are some things you can do to avoid 
problems or get the horse to realize pulling need not be stressful:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Pull after the horse has worked so its pours are open and resistance low.</li>
	<li>Often the solution is a simple as taking less hair at a time.  Maybe even try pulling 
out a few hairs everyday.  This way a horse that doesn't understand or has had a bad 
experience starts to learn pulling is not to be feared.</li>
	<li>Usually I thin and then shorten the mane, except when I think a horse will be 
defensive.  Then I blade first.  The horse should have no reason to complain about that 
procedure.  So, I shorten and then thin, to avoid getting the horse defensive from the 
outset.</li>
	<li>Back the horse into the back corner of a stall, you on the side closest to the door.  If 
a horse is going to resist, it'll run backwards.  Then the situation quickly turns chaotic.  
If you have the horse backed into a corner, you solve many problems from the outset.  
<strong>CAUTION:</strong> Be sure the hind end stays in the corner.  Be aware.  If the animal swings 
its hind end out, it's easy to get pinned against the wall.  This position is dangerous 
and avoidable.</li>
	<li>Do not start at one end of the mane and work toward the other.  Take from all over 
the mane, in a random pattern.  If you get half way down the mane and the horse has 
had enough, then you have made a mess.  If a horse had been good and needs a 
break, its time to stop.  Pulling is not something you work through.  It will not get 
easier as you continue.  If the horse starts to stress, come back to it another day.  
Otherwise the horse learns to resist.</li>
	<li>Watch for the horse's front feet.  If a horse goes up or to strike, this is very serious.  
It's too easy to be hurt.  Pulling that mane should be left to a professional.</li>
	<li>If a horse tries to bolt, there is an easy and quick solution.  Note where the big neck 
muscle crosses under the shoulder.  If you grab that muscle, the horse will suck back 
from you.  A horse needs to be aware of your space, and respect it.  This is a simple 
matter of good manners.  A muscle twitch is a quick, clear way to keep peace.</li>
	<li>If a horse is headshy, its afraid of what it thinks you might do.  A blind fold is a easy 
way to let the horse relax- out of sight, out of mind.  Wrap a towel twice around each 
side of the halter to cover the eye on the side you are working.  Be sure the towel is 
secured.  With one eye covered, the horse need not anticipate your movements and 
can settle down.</li
</ul>
