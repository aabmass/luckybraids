<p>Washing grooming brushes weekly is a good idea. Otherwise, you just push dirt around your horse's coat. Plus, skin disease is more apt to spread.</p>


<p>Two things to keep in mind</p>

<p>•	Antibacterial soap does not kill fungus. If you have Lucky Braids All-In-One Shampoo, it will cover all your bases.</p>

<p>•	Soaking is not enough. I take a bush in each hand and bush the bristles against each other, while submerged. This way, you won’t get splashed and the bushes clean each other.</p>

<p>•	Dry the brushes bristles down. This pulls water out of the handle. Otherwise, the moisture can rot the bristles’ base. So, you don’t want to soak them too long, either.</p>
 
<p>•	I like to find a clean ledge or wall and rest one end of the brush/bristles up on it. This angle allows some space under the bristles so they dry faster, while using gravity to pull water out of the base/grip. If you have to lay brushes on their side, that can work. Just be sure they are on a clean surface.</p>

<p>Clean brushes can clean horses! They'll last longer, too.</p>
